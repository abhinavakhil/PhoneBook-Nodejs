# PhoneBook-Nodejs
 ***Backend***
This Nodejs Application is based upon modularity and i followed the principles of mvc architecture while creating the rest Api.
Files Includes:
1) Create contacts
2) Update contacts
3) Delete contacts
4) Search contacts ( with Features like : sort , pagination , filtering )
5) Routing
6) ContactModel (for Contact Schema)

*used mongodb Atlas for creating and hosting the database
also for error handling , I created a global Error handler file AppError.

***Frontend***
created and implemented the creation of contact by user and navigating them to the home page.

But due to sortage of time : loading data in homepage and editing is left.

Note : Though i have tested all my api using postman and its working perfectly.

thanks.
